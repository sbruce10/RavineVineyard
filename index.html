    <div id="aboutRavine">
      <p>Although we're sure that every farm family feels the same about their 34 acre organic winery, at Ravine, we believe that ours is truly unique.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it's because of our approach to family. Our goal was to create a sustainable way to maintain our 100+ year old farm and continue to foster the legacy of our interest, follow dreams and find ways to continue to fall in love - with the land and each other.</p>
      <p>In that we have learned a lot, attracted some great people and extended our passionate family. The result is not only great wines from our mother, Lowrey Farm, but a wonderful lifestyle that we are eager and proud to share.</p>

      <div id="aboutWines">
        <p>The wines at Ravine Vineyard are often desribed as "elegant" or "refined". This style is as much a result of the terroir as it is of a unique winemaking effort.</p>
        <p>In the cellar, care and gentle guidance of the wines prevails during the entire winemaking process. Gravity flow is used throughout because it is very gentle on the juices and wines. All grapes are hand harvested and hand sorted on a state of the art, vibrating sorting table before going to the press or crusher destemmer.</p>
